# File Tracking System - Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

The system was experiencing intermittent errors with:
1. QR code printing failures ("error printing qr")
2. File fetching errors ("error fetching files")
3. Random failures after 2-3 uses

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Database Connection Issues**: MongoDB connection timeouts and poor connection management
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling for database operations
3. **QR Code Generation**: No retry logic for QR code generation failures
4. **Resource Management**: No timeouts or connection pooling

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Connection Improvements
- Added connection pooling with `maxPoolSize: 10`
- Implemented connection timeouts and retry logic
- Added connection event handlers for monitoring
- Configured proper socket timeout settings

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added timeout protection for all database queries (5-10 seconds)
- Implemented retry logic for QR code generation (3 attempts)
- Added global error handler middleware
- Created proper error pages with user-friendly messages

### 3. Client-Side Improvements
- Added loading states for forms and buttons
- Implemented connection status monitoring
- Added retry functionality for failed requests
- Enhanced print function with error handling

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Used `.lean()` queries for better performance
- Added query timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- Implemented health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Added periodic server health monitoring

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- Added refresh button on files page
- Improved loading indicators
- Better error messages with retry options
- Connection status notifications

## Files Modified

1. **server.js** - Main server file with database and error handling improvements
2. **public/js/main.js** - Client-side error handling and connection monitoring
3. **public/css/style.css** - Loading states and error styling
4. **views/layout.ejs** - Connection status indicator
5. **views/qrcode.ejs** - Enhanced print function
6. **views/files.ejs** - Refresh functionality

## New Features Added

1. **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` - Monitor system status
2. **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection status display
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed operations
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
5. **Error Recovery**: Better error messages with recovery options

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test QR code generation multiple times in succession
2. Test file listing with poor network conditions
3. Verify error handling by temporarily disconnecting from database
4. Test print functionality across different browsers
5. Monitor the `/health` endpoint for system status

## Monitoring

- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Monitor server logs for database connection issues
- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify system status
- Watch for connection status indicators in the UI

These fixes should significantly reduce the intermittent errors and provide a more stable user experience.
